# React Formik Yup Demo

This is a straightforward React project created with Vite, showcasing form handling and field validation using Formik and Yup. In this demo, I've explored two methods to handle the same signup form.

### Tech Stack:

- **Vite**: Fast build tool for modern web development.
- **React**: Library for building user interfaces
- **Formik**: Form management library for React applications.
- **Yup** : Schema builder for runtime value parsing and validation
- **CSS**: Styling the application

### Instructions:

1. Clone the repository. `https://github.com/abhimax/react-formik-yup-demo.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Run the project: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.

#### Method 01: Using `useFormik` Hook

In this approach, I've utilized the `useFormik` hook provided by Formik to streamline form management and validation.

#### Method 02: Using `Formik`, `Form`, `Field`

Here, I've demonstrated another method of handling the signup form by employing the `Formik`, `Form`, and `Field` components from the Formik library.

Feel free to explore both methods and choose the one that fits your project requirements. Happy coding!
